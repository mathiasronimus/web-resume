        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p class="topic">Communication</p>
        <p class="detail">My role as a tutor has helped me greatly in developing my communication skills. This job requires professionalism in communicating with stakeholders, the ability to explain difficult concepts in an intuitive way, and the ability to get along with all kinds of people. This skill would help me to integrate into a team environment.</p>
        <p class="topic">Self-Development</p>
        <p class="detail">My experience in University, as well as my capacity as a tutor, has given me a lot of insight into learning, which I've applied to my own life. I use the framework of deliberate practice to master new concepts quickly and effeciently. By giving direction to my practice, this has allowed me to become competent at new languages and skills quickly.</p>
        <p class="topic">Time Management</p>
        <p class="detail">I like to structure my time to ensure that I will get everything done that I need to - this allows me to have a good estimate of how long things will take, and allows more time for me to recharge as well. In my life, this has helped me to take on many responsibilities without falling behind in anything.</p>
        <p class="topic">Attention to Detail</p>
        <p class="detail">I believe detail makes the difference between an okay result and a great one. I have a strong eye for detail which allows me to make this difference - and I think has made the difference in my University work and personal projects.</p>
        <p class="topic">Working Under Pressure</p>
        <p class="detail">I work best under pressure, and I like to set time-specific goals for my work - since I believe work exands to fill the time you give it. This has helped me during tests in my schooling. In work, along with my time-management skills, it helps me in meeting specific deadlines.</p>
