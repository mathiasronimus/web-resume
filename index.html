        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p class="topic">Communication</p>
        <p class="detail">I'm a measured and thoughtful communicator, in both a written and oral capacity. This has helped me a lot as a tutor, which requires me to communicate often difficult concepts in an intuitive way. I also believe this way of thinking helps me to communicate visually in front-end user interface work.</p>
        <p class="topic">Self-Development</p>
        <p class="detail">My capacity as a tutor has also given me a lot of insight into learning, which I've applied to my own life. I use the framework of deliberate practice to master new concepts quickly and effeciently. This has helped me to keep on top of University despite the other things I have going on in my life.</p>
        <p class="topic">Time Management</p>
        <p class="detail">I like to structure my time to ensure that I will get everything done that I need - this allows me to work effectively on my own, rather than relying on outside sources to keep me going. In a team environment, this means people don't have to pester me to get things done.</p>
        <p class="topic">Attention to Detail</p>
        <p class="detail">I believe detail makes the difference between an OK result and a great one. I have a strong eye for detail which allows me to make this difference - and I think has made the difference in my University work and personal projects.</p>
        <p class="topic">Working Under Pressure</p>
        <p class="detail">I work best under pressure, and I like to set time-specific goals for my work - since I believe work exands to fill the time you give it. This has helped me during tests in my schooling, as well as during tutoring sessions.</p>
